    <Card.Title>Peter Clayborne</Card.Title>
    <Card.Text>Peter Clayborne is the son of Ann Clayborne and Simon Frazier, being one of the first children born on Mars. Peter holds a position of older brother to all of the following first generation. Many revolutionary and later political decisions of the Mars First movement are influenced by his opinions and judgment. He works part-time as an engineer and a green politician.</Card.Text>
    <Card.Title>Zoya "Zo" Boone</Card.Title>
    <Card.Text>Jackie's daughter; she has feline traits (purring) inserted into her genome via the gerontological longevity treatment. In Blue Mars, she travels the solar system running political errands for Jackie, although the two do not get along particularly well. Her character is portrayed as hedonistic and explicitly nihilistic, making sexual satisfaction a priority and seemingly having little regard for the feelings of others. On the other hand, she apparently has a conscience, risking her life to rescue a man on Mercury and later dying in an attempt to save a distressed flier.</Card.Text>
    <Card.Title>Nikki</Card.Title>
    <Card.Text>The daughter of Nadia and Art.</Card.Text>
    <Card.Title>Arthur "Art" Randolph</Card.Title>
    <Card.Text>A representative of the Praxis corporation sent to contact the Martian underground movement on a quasi-diplomatic mission in an attempt to create a system of ecological capitalism based on democratic corporations. Like the other metanationals, it takes on intensive economic and political ties with governments, but Praxis aims for partnerships rather than exploitive relationships.</Card.Text>
    <Card.Title>Zeyk Tuqan</Card.Title>
    <Card.Text>Bedouin nomads who originally emigrated from Egypt and respected figures in the Arab Martian community. Zeyk is a close friend of Chalmers. His eidetic memory becomes a minor plot point.</Card.Text>
    <Card.Title>William Fort</Card.Title>
    <Card.Text>The founder of Praxis, one of the huge multinational corporations. He embraces a fusion of Eastern and Western lifestyles.</Card.Text>
